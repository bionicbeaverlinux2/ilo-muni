---

This page is about **how to use and understand ilo Muni**. If you want to know
how or why ilo Muni exists, or want to talk to me,
[see the about page!](/ilo-muni/about)

Otherwise, follow the tutorial by starting from [search](#search), or use the
[cheatsheet](#cheatsheet) below!

## Cheatsheet

- Search words or phrases up to **6 words long**
- Search **multiple phrases** by splitting them with comma `,`
- Use **wildcard** `*` in place of a word in a phrase to get top phrases
- **Add** phrases with `+`, **subtract** with `-`
- Add `_` and a number from 1-6 on a phrase to set its **minimum sentence
  length**, or use the dropdown to set it for everything at once
- Higher smoothing makes noisy graphs easier to read
- Absolute scales show or use the number of times a word appeared
- Relative scales show or use the percentage of times a word appeared
- Minmax scales and log scales are good for comparing trends
- **o alasa pona! Search responsibly!**

## Table of Contents

## Search

### Words

Search for a **[toki pona word](https://linku.la/)** such as
[**pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=pona). If it appeared at least 40 times across all
the places and times I checked, you'll get a graph showing how that word has
been used over time! By default, you'll see what percentage of all words were
the searched word with monthly datapoints.

You can also search for proper names like [**Sonko**](/ilo-muni/?query=sonko),
[**Inli**](/ilo-muni/?query=inli), or [**Siko**](/ilo-muni/?query=Siko). There
are lots of very rare words in the database too. You might be surprised by what
you find, so try lots of things!

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See the start and growth of words coined only a few years ago like
  [**tonsi**](/ilo-muni/?query=tonsi) or
  [**misikeke**](/ilo-muni/?query=misikeke)
- Explore the use of rarer words like [**majuna**](/ilo-muni/?query=majuna),
  [**linluwi**](/ilo-muni/?query=linluwi), or [**kiki**](/ilo-muni/?query=kiki)

</details>

### Phrases

You can search for **up to 6 words in one phrase**, such as
[**mi kama sona e toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=mi+kama+sona+e+toki+pona). Note
that the more words are in a phrase, the fewer times it is likely to appear- so
don't be surprised if you don't get a result. Try searching for shorter phrases,
like [**kama pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=kama+pona) or
[**anu seme**](/ilo-muni/?query=anu+seme).

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Watch the rising popularity of phrases like
  [**kin la**](/ilo-muni/?query=kin+la)
- Watch phrases come and go over time as the things they reference do, like
  [**tenpo pana**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=0),
  [**tenpo monsuta**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+monsuta&smoothing=0), or
  [**suno pi toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&smoothing=0)
- Examine the use of grammatical features like
  [**kepeken e**](/ilo-muni/?query=kepeken+e)

</details>

### Multiple Searches

You can graph **multiple phrases at once** by separating them with commas `,`,
even mixing words and phrases:
[**toki, pona, toki pona**](/ilo-muni?query=toki,+pona,+toki+pona). Often,
different words or phrases will have very different amounts of use, resulting in
it being hard to read more than the top one or two graphs. You can address that
with [alternate scales](#scales) later in this tutorial.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Compare former synonyms like [**lukin, oko**](/ilo-muni/?query=lukin,+oko)
- See the close relationship between similar words like
  [**pan, kili**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan,+kili) or
  [**laso, loje, jelo, walo, pimeja**](/ilo-muni/?query=laso,+loje,+jelo,+walo,+pimeja)
- Compare the modifiers that appear after specific words, like
  [**wawa a, wawa mute, wawa lili, wawa suli, wawa sewi**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa+a,+wawa+mute,+wawa+lili,+wawa+suli,+wawa+sewi)
- Examine how people talk about their skill in toki pona with
  [**sona toki pona, sona e toki pona, sona pi toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=sona+toki+pona,+sona+e+toki+pona,+sona+pi+toki+pona)
- Compare greetings over time, like
  [**sina seme, sina pali e seme**](/ilo-muni/?query=sina+seme,+sina+pali+e+seme)
- See how popular Sonja's books are with
  [**pu, ku, su**](/ilo-muni/?query=pu,+ku,+su)

</details>

### Wildcard

You can search for **multiple phrases of the same form** with a wildcard by
replacing **one word other than the first** in a phrase with `*`. This will
search for the **ten most popular phrases** that match your search and graph
them.

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Estimate the most popular prep phrases for "tawa":
  [**tawa \***](suli:4321/ilo-muni?query=tawa+*)
- Observe the disparity in the top 1-2 uses of a word versus the rest:
  [**sona \***](/ilo-muni?query=sona+*), [**ona \***](/ilo-muni?query=ona+*)

</details>

### Adding phrases

You can **add two or more phrases together** by putting a `+` between them. This
is helpful for combining synonyms, like
[**ale + ali**](/ilo-muni/?query=ale+%2B+ali). You can also use it to compare
multiple related words to another one, like
[**pan + kili, moku**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku).

It often helps to graph some or all of the summed phrases with the independent
phrases so you can see how much the graph has shifted, such as in
[**pan + kili, moku, pan, kili**](/ilo-muni/?query=pan+%2B+kili,+moku,+pan,+kili)

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- See what portion of toki pona is pure particles:
  [**li, e, la, pi, o, en, anu**](/ilo-muni/?query=li+%2B+e+%2B+la+%2B+pi+%2B+o+%2B+en+%2B+anu)
- Combine multiple ways to write the same word, like
  [**ala + x**](/ilo-muni/?query=ala+%2B+x) or
  [**anu + y, anu, y**](/ilo-muni/?query=anu+%2B+y,+anu,+y)
- Do that with UCSUR text specifically:
  [**toki + 󱥬**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+%2B+󱥬)
- Combine related words to compare to others:
  [**a + n, pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=a+%2B+n,+pona)

</details>

### Subtracting phrases

You can **subtract one or more phrases from another** by putting a `-` between
them. This is helpful when you'd like to omit a specific use of a word, such as
in [**toki - toki pona**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+-+toki+pona). This gives you all
the uses of the word "toki" which are not in the phrase "toki pona".

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Determine what grammatical positions a phrase is most common in:
  [**tenpo ni - tenpo ni la - lon tenpo ni, tenpo ni**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+ni+-+tenpo+ni+la+-+lon+tenpo+ni,+tenpo+ni)
- Examine the use of a word without other conflicting terms, like in
  [**san - kekan san**](/ilo-muni/?query=san+-+kekan+san)

</details>

### Set Minimum Sentence Length

You can **set a minimum sentence length** for one term by adding an underscore
`_` and a number from 1 to 6 **to the end of that term**. For example,
[**toki_1, toki_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+toki_6) will show you the percentage
of times toki appeared in any sentence, versus the smaller percentage of times
that it was in specifically sentences of length 6. You can do this with phrases
too: [**ona li, ona li_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=ona+li,+ona+li_6)

You can use this with subtraction to isolate a word or phrase: The search
[**toki - toki_2**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+-+toki_2) will show you every time
"toki" appeared, minus the times it appeared in sentences with 2 or more words-
which means you have all the times "toki" was the only word in the sentence. Or,
put another way, all the times toki meant "hello"! (except for the times it was
an answer to a question, of course!)

Read ahead to
[the options section on Minimum Sentence Length](#minimum-sentence-length) for
more details!

<details>
  <summary>**Examples**</summary>

- Get even more accurate information about greetings:
  [**sina seme - sina seme_3, sina pali e seme - sina pali e seme_5**](/ilo-muni/?query=sina+seme+-+sina+seme_3,+sina+pali+e+seme+-+sina+pali+e+seme_5)
  - See if there is a difference in relative use of words:
    [**toki, pona, toki_6, pona_6**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+pona,+toki_6,+pona_6).
    (there is! "pona" is more common in short sentences; "toki" is more common
    in long sentences!)

</details>

---

## Options

Note: [Scale has its own section](#scales), because it's much more complicated
than the other options.

### Minimum Sentence Length

By default, **All sentences** is set, meaning you will see how words or phrases
appear in any length of sentence. If you set this option to **3+ words per
sentence**, you'll see how words or phrases appear in sentences which have **at
least 3 words**. This can be helpful if you want to study more "substantial"
uses of words, i.e. those that appear in longer sentences.

If one of your searches
[sets the minimum sentence length for a term](#set-minimum-sentence-length), pay
attention to the legend: If the legend shows the term without an underscore, it
means the length you chose was already being searched for anyway. This can
happen with a search like [**toki pona_2**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki+pona_2)
normally, or [**wawa_3**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa_3&minSentLen=3) while the
minimum sentence length is set to 3.

This happens to the phrase **toki pona** with a minimum sentence length of 2
because phrases have a minimum sentence length equal to how many words are in
them. That is, "toki pona" can only appear in sentences with at least two words-
which I hope makes sense! Because of this, the minimum sentence length is always
implicitly set to at least the length of the phrase. You can always set it to be
higher, of course.

Note that when graphing on any **relative scale**, the percentage is derived by
dividing the number of occurrences for the search term by the total number of
words in the same time period.

If you're curious why this is done instead of dividing by the number of words in
sentences of the appropriate minimum length, here's a simplified example:

<details>
<summary>**Demonstration**</summary>

Imagine the following scenario:

- There are 10,000 words
- 9,000 of those words are in sentences with at least 2 words
- 100 of the words are **toki**
- 90 of those **toki** are in sentences with at least 2 words

With this data, asking "What percentage of words are toki?" means we get 1% (100
/ 10,000), which makes sense, and this is the only reasonable question to
measure toki on its own.

However, there are two ways to measure toki in sentences with at least 2 words
(**toki_2**): You could measure it as a portion of all words, or as a portion of
words from sentences with at least 2 words. These two different choices have
different results: **toki_2** is **0.9%** (90 / 10,000) of all words, but **1%**
(90 / 9,000) of the words in sentences with at least 2 words.

We can use this information to determine which answer is best for this graphing
tool by exploring what happens when you search **toki - toki_2**.

In the sample data, graphing **toki - toki_2** with toki_2 measured as a portion
of all words means we get **0.1%**: ((100 - 90) / 10,000). That is, toki appears
exactly 10 times on its own in this data. Graphing instead with **toki_2**
measured as a portion of words in sentences with 2 or more words means we get
**0%**: ((100 / 10,000) - (90 / 9,000)). In other words, we get a misleading
outcome because we're subtracting two incomparable percentages.

There is value in knowing what portion of sentences with at least 2 words are
some specific word. This graphing tool does not offer that information because
doing so would produce misleading graphs for both side-by-side comparison and
for adding or subtracting specific results. If you're interested in that
alternate data,

### Smoother

By default, **Window Avg** is set, and I don't recommend changing it from the
default unless you're aware of what change you're making and why.

### Smoothing

By default, **2 smoothing** is set. The number is how many neighbors **on both
sides** of a given data point will be smoothed. For example, if you set **5
smoothing** with the **Window Avg** smoother, it means a given point will be set
to the average of the 5 points before, 5 points after, and itself.

Smoothing is helpful for making noisy graphs more readable while preserving the
trend line of the original graph. Compare the graphs of **wawa, nasa, suwi,
sewi, suli** with
[**0 smoothing**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa,+nasa,+suwi,+sewi,+suli&smoothing=0) and
[**5 smoothing**](/ilo-muni/?query=wawa,+nasa,+suwi,+sewi,+suli&smoothing=5).

Note that smoothing can produce misleading graphs with respect to the time axis,
such as
[**smearing periodic phrases over too much time**](/ilo-muni/?query=tenpo+pana&smoothing=10)
or
[**implying that misikeke was used before November 2019**](/ilo-muni/?query=misikeke&smoothing=10&smoother=gauss)
with specific smoothers. Sometimes, **0 smoothing** is better!

{/* NOTE: smoothing used to smear to before a term existed too, but this is fixed */}

Some [scales](#scales) will have smoothing disabled, usually because it wouldn't
make sense to average their values. This applies to the **absolute** scale, for
example, because it is meant to show you the exact number of times a given word
or phrase appeared! This also applies to both offered **derivatives**, because
they are completely impervious to localized averaging.

### Dates

By default, the date range for the graph is set from **August 2016** to **August
2024**. You can select any start or end you want, but there are some caveats to
warn you about:

First, the graph ends in July 2024. This is because I collected this data during
August, so it is incomplete after July. For that matter, it is differently
incomplete depending on the platform and specific community, because I cannot
collect them all simultaneously. The August data is in the database, but it
produces misleading graphs to include, so I have omitted it from display.

Second, the default start date is **August 2016** because the data prior to that
is extremely sparse. I have left in the option to query for that data, but
understand that the relative graphs will be noisy, the absolute graphs will be
flat, minmax graphs will become nonsense- and for the other graphs, here be
dragons.

Lastly, it is important to note that the way I store the data is a potential
source of bias. If you're curious, read the following:

<details>
<summary>**Discussion**</summary>

In the database, I count words in monthly "buckets." You can see this on the
graph, where each point aligns with a specific month and is labeled as such.
This is a straight-forward way to graph and read the data, but it has some
disadvantages for interpretability.

Some months are shorter than others, so [the absolute scale](#absolute) may be
misleading for those periods, implying they were less active than neighboring
months. Similarly, weeks are not evenly distributed over months, so some months
will have more weekends and therefore more active periods than others.
Fortunately, this doesn't change [the relative scale](#relative), since that is
measured as a percentage of words said.

Still, in the future I would like to change the size of the time "buckets" to be
4-weekly, to reduce or eliminate the above described biases.

</details>

## Scales

### Absolute

The **Absolute scale** shows the exact number of times a given word or phrase
was said in each time period. This is useful for observing
[trends in the activity of the community](/ilo-muni/?query=li+%2B+mi+%2B+e+%2B+ni+%2B+la+%2B+toki+%2B+pona+%2B+lon+%2B+ala+%2B+sina&scale=abs),
but can make it difficult to compare words which are
[of very different magnitude](/ilo-muni/?query=a,+kin&scale=abs), or to study
the use of toki pona
[before March 2020](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+pona,+toki+pona&scale=abs&start=1438387200&end=1564617600).

If you're interested in comparing two or more absolute graphs, but one word is
vastly more popular than the others, check again using the
[Absolute Minmax scale](#absolute-minmax).

### Relative

The **Relative scale** is the default scale, and shows you what **percentage of
all words** are the searched term in each time period on the graph. This also
applies to phrases, for which you would interpret as follows: "What portion of
all words are **any one word** from this phrase?"

The justification for doing the math this way is similar to that for
[minimum sentence length](#minimum-sentence-length), which you can read about
below. Spoiler: I dunk on Google.

<details>
<summary>**Discussion**</summary>

As with minimum sentence length, there is more than one meaningful question that
could be asked about phrases. In this case, there are three:

#### What percentage of all same-length phrases are this phrase?

This method has the same problem of incomparable percentages as seen in minimum
sentence lengths: There isn't a way to compare "toki" and "toki pona" if their
percentages are measured against unrelated totals- and "percentage of all words"
is not comparable to "percentage of all bigrams". Strangely,
[Google Ngrams does this intentionally according to their info page](https://books.google.com/ngrams/info),
in spite of the fact that they allow you to add and subtract n-grams of
different length. Direct quote, with bold added by me:

> What the y-axis shows is this: **of all the bigrams** contained in our sample
> of books written in English and published in the United States, **what
> percentage of them** are "nursery school" or "child care"?

#### What percentage of all words are this phrase?

For graphing a single bi-gram, you can get interesting results from this
question. To do this, we would multiply the number of times the phrase occurred
by the length of the phrase, then divide by the total number of words. This
means that, percentage-wise, each phrase counts for all of its words.

This is a problem, which we can see with a search such as **toki - toki pona**.
This math implies we would remove some occurrences of "pona" from occurrences of
"toki," because the phrase "toki pona" accounts for both of its words. There
were never any occurrences of "pona" in the occurrences of "toki," so we would
get a lower result than expected.

#### What percentage of all words are any word in this phrase?

In this method, the search **toki - toki pona** means to remove all occurrences
of "toki pona" from "toki". Since the phrase "toki pona" is only counted for how
many times it appeared, and not for its number of words, the math works out: we
are only removing the occurrences of any one word in the phrase "toki pona" from
the word "toki". This method treats phrases as a form of context, so you could
that search as follows: Remove all occurrences of "toki" that were in the phrase
"toki pona" from occurrences of the word "toki."

Because the search is now interpretable contextually, we get an unexpected and
powerful new capability: The phrase can stand in for any of its words. For
example, we could search for **pona - toki pona**, and the result makes sense:
Remove all occurrences of "pona" that appear in "toki pona" from occurrences of
"pona."

Even better, you can replicate the previous method by subtracting a phrase once
for each word in it. If we did want to remove every word in 'toki pona' from
'toki', as in the second method, we can search **toki - toki pona - toki pona**
to get that result.

Last note: If you're a math academic reading this, I am terribly, terribly sorry
for not using real notation to demonstrate the above. I assure you, these plain
language explanations are much less embarassing than any attempt I would make to
use set notation.

</details>

The relative scale is the most generally useful scale, as it implicitly tells
you the relationship of your search term to all other terms by showing a
percentage instead of a raw number. For example, you can compare
[**the grammatical particles**](/ilo-muni/?query=li,+e,+la,+o,+a&scale=rel) or
[**the colors**](/ilo-muni/?query=laso%2C+loje%2C+jelo%2C+walo%2C+pimeja&scale=rel).

It can be difficult to compare relative graphs for words which are in different
magnitudes, such as
[**kijetesantakalu, soweli**](/ilo-muni/?query=kijetesantakalu%2C+soweli&scale=rel).
I recommend the [Relative Minmax scale](#relative-minmax) for cases like these,
which can help to identify words which trend in the same way no matter their
magnitude.

### Cumulative

The **Cumulative scale** shows you how many times a given word has been said up
to a point in time, increasing to the total number of times the word has been
said by the present. This is handy for
[**observing the point where a word or phrase becomes more spoken than another**](/ilo-muni/?query=sina+seme,+sina+pali+e+seme&scale=cmsum),
or
[**differently examining periodic phrases**](/ilo-muni/?query=suno+pi+toki+pona&minSentLen=1&scale=cmsum).
It can also help to clarify the fact that, while one word has become more
popular than another in the recent past,
[**it may not have done so all-time**](/ilo-muni/?query=kokosila,+penpo&scale=cmsum)

### Relative Log

The **Relative Log scale** is the natural logarithm of the
[relative scale](#relative), and it is useful for comparing trends in words of
different magnitudes while preserving their popularity order. For example,
[kijetesantakalu, soweli](/ilo-muni/?query=kijetesantakalu,+soweli&scale=logrel)
are now much closer in scale while not errantly implying that kijetesantakalu
exceeded soweli in popularity as [Relative Minmax](relative-minmax) would.

### Relative Minmax

The **Relative Minmax scale** normalizes all the points in the **relative**
graph to be between 0 and 1 while preserving the original curve of the graph.
This is excellent for demonstrating that words like
[**ona, li**](/ilo-muni/?query=ona%2C+li&scale=normrel) trend similarly with use
while being in different magnitudes.

### Absolute Minmax

The **Absolute Minmax scale** normalizes all the points in the **absolute**
graph to be between 0 and 1 while preserving the original curve of the graph.
This makes it helpful for demonstrating that
[**toki, meli**](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+meli&scale=normabs) trend similarly with
community activity while being in different mangitudes. This even applies
[when comparing words and phrases](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+pona,+wawa+mute&scale=normabs).

## Weird Scales

Sorry- these aren't filled out yet, because I ran out of time while preparing
for [suno pi toki pona](https://suno.pona.la/2024/). I'll come back for them!
Rest assured that I do not have anything useful to say about them yet.

{/* ### Absolute Log */} {/* ### Relative Entropy */}
{/* ### Absolute Entropy */} {/* ### Relative Z-Score */}
{/* ### Absolute 1st Derivative */} {/* ### Relative 1st Derivative */}

## Potential Bias

I discussed ways that [smoothing](#smoothing) and [dates](#dates) can create
misleading graphs, but these are not the only forms of bias possible. Most of
the remaining bias is in where and how the data is collected.

### Bots

Every platform has bots which send messages, but not every platform is gracious
enough to inform you that a given message is from a bot. Fortunately, almost no
bots are sending messages in toki pona, but there are a handful worth being
aware of because they artificially increase the use of any word or phrase they
use if counted.

#### Discord

Discord does an excellent job of informing you that a given user is a bot, but
things get mixed up when it comes to webhooks because of
[PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/). Normally, webhooks are a kind of bot message
which is sent automatically but is not attached to any user. They tend to be
notifications for things happening on other platforms, like commits on Github or
posts on Reddit. However, PluralKit messages are webhook messages from users.
Right now, I can't distinguish between PluralKit messages and any other type of
webhook, so I'm forced to count both or neither- and I chose to count both. This
means there is some uncertain amount of bot data in the Discord data.
Fortunately, only 4.6% of the data is from webhooks, so the impact of this
cannot be _too_ large.

In the future, I plan to grab all the webhook messages I have and ask the
PluralKit API whether those messages are PluralKit messages. Then I would be
able to map those messages back to the host account which originally sent the
message, and I could then count only user messages.

#### Telegram

On Telegram, I have no way to know if a given user is a bot. Telegram's JSON
export format does not include that information. I do have one hard-coded
exception, the IRC forwarding bot, because I needed to cut the names out of its
messages to represent them as intended. Otherwise, all Telegram bots are
invisible to me. That said, all of the ones I've seen speak English, so they
shouldn't have any counted sentences.

#### Reddit

Reddit does not tell you if a given user is a bot as far as I'm aware. Can't fix
it, but like Telegram, none of the bots on Reddit seem to speak toki pona- so no
harm done!

### Herbevitistoj

Herbevitistoj is "Many people who professionally avoid grass." It's a fairly
recent and silly way that
[Esperanto speakers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) refer to the
"terminally online," or termed more kindly, people who are on the internet a
lot. Most toki pona is spoken on the internet in the first place, but there is
still a subset of the community which makes up an outsized portion of messages
written in toki pona because they are much more active in online spaces. There
isn't anything to be done about this- it's just a fact to be aware of.

That said, I am personally curious to see what the data would look like if the
most active 20% of users were removed from it- maybe something to do in the
future.

### Platform Notes

#### Discord

Right now, the data for ilo Muni is collected from Discord, Telegram, and
Reddit. Of these, Discord is about 80% of all of the data, and
[ma pona pi toki pona](https://discord.gg/mapona) in particular is about 80% of
the data from Discord. You can see the impact of that one server from sections
of the graph
[like this](/ilo-muni/?query=toki,+pona&minSentLen=1&scale=abs&start=1627776000&end=1722470400),
where a small number of archived channels caused a nearly 50% decline in use of
toki pona.

In a sense, Discord is "over-represented" in the data, because it is such a
large portion of the data in the first place. For the time being, I have chosen
to weight all messages equally, but I would like to produce alternate databases
and analyses in the future.

#### Telegram

As far as I'm aware, I found and successfully exported the entire history of
every public toki pona channel on Telegram. No notes.

#### Reddit

Unfortunately,
[the pricing for Reddit's API was changed drastically in summer 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Reddit_API_controversy).
This means it is now either difficult or expensive to collect data from the
platform, and the user API only allows scrolling back as much as 1000 posts.
Fortunately,
[/u/raiderbdev has done the archival work and /u/Watchful1 has sorted it](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/1akrhg3/separate_dump_files_for_the_top_40k_subreddits/),
so there is Reddit data available, but that data only goes to the end of 2023.
As such, there is no Reddit data during 2024. Additionally, the linked archive
data only covers the top 40,000 subreddits, which means it only covers
[/r/tokipona](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokipona/) and not any of the other toki
pona subreddits such as [/r/mi_lon](https://www.reddit.com/r/mi_lon/) or
[/r/tokiponataso](https://www.reddit.com/r/tokiponataso/).

### Identifying toki pona

This data would not exist without first being able to detect whether a message
is "in toki pona". I wrote [a library](https://github.com/gregdan3/sona-toki) to
do this, but it has its own collection of complexities which can impact how you
interpret the data.

I chose to use the dictionary from [lipu Linku](https://linku.la), including its
[sandbox](https://linku.la/sandbox), in order to to identify definite "toki pona
words." These weren't the only words I counted, because that would miss anything
that weren't already in my dictionary. But it still isn't perfect.

#### Dictionary

If a word in my dictionary matches a word in another language, I would errantly
count that word while scoring the sentence. My scoring algorithm has no concept
of a penalty currently, so I couldn't identify that the words around a given one
were specifically of some language other than toki pona- I'd just know they
didn't match any of my filters.

This is especially troublesome if a message is a single word in my dictionary,
or otherwise very short. "je" is borderline non-existent in toki pona, but it's
in the dictionary, and it's a first person pronoun in French!

#### Short words

While writing my sentence scoring algorithm, I noticed that there were tons of
1-2 letter words in other languages which would errantly match my scoring
filter, and thus errantly raise the score of messages that were not in toki
pona.

To fix this, I changed my syllable checking and alphabetic match checking
filters to only score if a given word has at least three letters.

For the most part, this is a good assumption: two letter words are rare enough
that I almost certainly have them all in my dictionary already. Doubly so for
one letter words, since there are only six possible (a, e, i, o, u, n).

But this means that, if a two letter word were coined, and it were not added to
my dictionary, I would score it zero by default- it could still be discovered if
it were next to many other toki pona words, but it would drag down the score of
the sentence it's in.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does it take so long to get a graph?

Searching for one or a few specific terms should only take a few seconds, but to
be real: You're reading a big SQLite blob over the network, making requests to
it one by one. I can only speed this up so much.

If I had a database hosting solution, nearly all of the queries would be as
instant as the network itself. If you have any suggestions for one,
[let me know!](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues/new)

### Why is the graph empty?

This is an error handling issue. You made a search with a malformed term and I
didn't catch and throw it out. Oops. I already know why this is happening, but
I'm going to fix this later. Feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues/new) though!

### Why is my subtraction negative?

That's allowed! If you do
[**tawa pona - kama pona**](ilo-muni/?query=tawa+pona+-+kama+pona), you'll get a
graph which is mostly negative. This means the phrase "kama pona" is more common
than the phrase "tawa pona", probably because the community is very welcoming!

It's _probably_ possible to get floating point silliness when subtracting, but I
haven't seen that happen personally-
[please reach out if you spot it](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues/new)!

Note: the y-axis scale may sometimes display in scientific notation instead of
integers or rationals. This is not an error! That's just ChartJS!

### Why is the data so noisy before 2020?

In short, there is much less data to examine from before 2020. This is why I set
the default start date to August 2016, rather than the actual start of my data
in August 2010.

So the next question is, why 2020? Although I probably don't need to answer
that, I'll go ahead and do so:

When everyone was trapped indoors for some two years during the COVID-19
pandemic, toki pona saw a huge spike in popularity. You can see the climb in
activity in every word when the scale is set to "absolute". This also affects
the relative graph though- before 2020, each word written is a much larger
portion of all the words for that time period! To help, you can add smoothing to
relative mode, which will average out

### Why is there a huge spike on [date] for [word]?

This data isn't from **_professional_** sources, unlike Google Ngrams which is
sourced entirely from published books. In **_professional_** sources, you
wouldn't expect an editor to let a paragraph like **woo yeah! woo yeah! woo
yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah! woo yeah!** remain in the final product. But in
Discord and any other social media platform, there is no editorial oversight-
silly goofy abounds. This affects mu, wan, tu, luka, mute, ale, and probably
others, which you can see
[here](/ilo-muni/?query=mu,+wan,+tu,+luka,+mute,+ale&minSentLen=1&scale=absolute&smoothing=0).
If you spot others,
[let me know!](https://github.com/gregdan3/ilo-muni/issues/new)

Relatedly, there was a time during development where "mu" had a spike to **over
40,000 uses** because of a day in which a handful of messages were nothing but
"mu" to the text limit of Discord. Because of this, I added a nonsense filter to
skip sentences before they get counted, which works like so: If a sentence is
more than 10x the **average sentence length (4.13557)** and more than 50% a
single word, it gets thrown out. Similarly, if a sentence is more than 100x the
average sentence length, it gets thrown out immediately. This filter isn't
perfect though, because somebody can say "mu. mu. mu." to similar effect, and
each of those will be counted as individual sentences. Working on it!

Ultimately, I would like this data to reflect how toki pona is actually used-
and, granted, somebody sending hundreds of "mu" is using toki pona. But I think
most people would agree that those messages are not reflective of how toki pona
is used, and they otherwise make it difficult to examine the rest of the data.
