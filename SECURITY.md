Hello and welcome to the ilo-muni open source project!

This guide explains how to report any security issues or vulnerabilities you find on our website. It’s pretty straightforward.

Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover any vulnerability on the website, please report it directly to the project owner via email at:
gregdan3@protonmail.com

The owner will review your report and decide whether to accept the vulnerability patch request. If accepted, the issue will be communicated to all maintainers and contributors so it can be fixed promptly.
